                        I moved to Austin about 4 years ago, looking for a change--more specifically, a career change.
                        Within 3 months of moving here, I got a job as a QA in a big company. Working there, I
                        learned a lot about general software testing, but more so, automated testing. This is what I
                        went on to do at my second QA gig, this time at a smaller company. I've been at this job for
                        about 2 years, and I was the only QA/QE up until some weeks ago.

                        Before moving to Austin, I lived in Baltimore for about 4 years. I initially went there to go
                        to grad school, which I attended for about 2 years. While doing research, I realized that I
                        enjoyed the coding aspect of what I was doing a lot more than the research itself.
                        I eventually left graduate school, and started working part time jobs while applying to
                        software-related ones. The process didn't pan out too well in Baltimore, so I moved here to try
                        my luck again. And then I got my first real job in a software company.
